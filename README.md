# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to assist Alphabet Soup successfully predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Results
Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
Verifying if the target is marked as successful in the Dataframe, indicating that it was successfully funded by Alphabet Soup. 
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
3. What steos did you take to try and increase model performance?
